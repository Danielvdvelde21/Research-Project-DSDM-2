# Project Name: Smart Watch Health Monitoring for Children with Asthma and Cystic
Fibrosis

## Description
This project aims to predicts astha attacks for kids. The project includes data sets, preprocessing methods, data analysis, and model experimentation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

### 1. Data
This folder contains raw datasets of healthy, astmathic and cistic fibrosis patients.

#### Subdirectory: Preprocessed Data Sets
This subdirectory contains preprocessed datasets generated using three different methods described in the project report. The preprocessed datasets are stored in separate files.

### 2. Logistics
This folder includes non-code materials, such as project information, planning documents, and any relevant resources related to the project logistics.

### 3. Code
This folder contains the code for various aspects of the project:

#### Subfolder: EDA
This subfolder includes files and scripts related to the data analysis phase of the project. It may contain exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts, statistical analysis scripts, visualization code, and any other files relevant to data analysis.

#### Subfolder: Preprocessing
The preprocessing subfolder contains files for different preprocessing methods used in the project. These files may include data cleaning, feature engineering, and other preprocessing techniques specific to the dataset.

#### Subfolder: Modeling
This subfolder contains code related to model development and experimentation. It includes scripts for building machine learning models, training and evaluation processes, and any experimentation related to the project's objectives.

## How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Access the different folders to explore the project's components:
   - **Data**: Review the healthy kids and immunocompromised datasets. Additionally, explore the preprocessed datasets in the "Preprocessed Data Sets" subdirectory.
   - **Logistics**: Access project planning and information documents.
   - **Code**: Explore the different subfolders:
     - **Data Analysis**: Review files for data analysis, EDA, and visualization.
     - **Preprocessing**: Access preprocessing files for various methods.
     - **Model and Experimentation**: Review code related to model development and experimentation.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the code. Check any provided requirements or environment files for further instructions.
